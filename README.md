# Sudoku Solver in Python

This project uses a simple backtracking method to work it's way through a sudoku puzzle in order to solve it. The puzzle is loaded in from a .csv file, checked for compatibility and then solved.

This project was done for the monthly (2020-05) Zero-To-Mastery coding challenge.
